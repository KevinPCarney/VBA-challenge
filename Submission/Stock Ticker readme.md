# VBA-challenge

This submission is for the Week 2 homework regarding VBA programming in Excel.

During this project we were given source code for approximately 93000 different stock transactions.  It was our objective to work with loops to take all the data from the stock transactions and summarize via quarter what the overall and % changes from the starting open to the final close for each stock were.  We did some conditional formatting to color the relevant cells and did a final leader board that showed what the Max and Min stocks were, as well as the greatest overall stock portfolio per quarter.

Inside this submission there is the following:
    The stock data with the relevant data added and analyzed
    Screenshots for each Quarter (sheet) showing the key data points
    The VBA code by itself
